# clj-cctray [![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/build-canaries/clj-cctray/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/build-canaries/clj-cctray/branch/master)

A Clojure library designed to parse the cctray format into a user friendly clojure map.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns your-app.core
  (:require [clj-cctray.core :as :parser]))

(parser/get-projects "some-url")
(parser/get-projects "some-url" :options [:some-option])
```

## Options

Options allow you to modify the output based on modifiers included in the project. Options are a map of keywords with
values, most options will require it's value to be in a specific format. Extensive checks are currently not performed
on option values to ensure this is the case, this is the responsibility of the user of this library.

- `:server`
  A keyword representing the CI server the xml is coming from to allow any server specific parsing. Currently the only
  servers that require specific parsing are `:go` and `:snap`.

- `:normalise`
  This will cause various names (if they exist) to be normalised (see below for more details about normalisation). Can
  take the values `:all`, `:name`, `:stage` or `:job`.

- `:strict-certificate-checks`
  By default SSL certificates are not checked (more info below), setting this option to `true` will cause them to be
  checked. Can also be set to `false` but since this is the default behaviour there is no reason to do so.

- `:http-timeout-seconds`
  Setting this option to any valid `integer` will set the timeout of http connections in seconds. The default timeout
  is 30 seconds.

## Map keys

- `:name`
  The name of the project.

- `:activity`
  The current state of the project as a keyword. Either `:sleeping`, `:building` or `:checking-modifications`.

- `:last-build-status`
  A brief description of the last build as a keyword. Either `:success`, `:failure`, `:exception` or `:unknown`.

- `:last-build-label`
  The build label exactly as it appeared in the xml file.

- `:last-build-time`
  When the last build occurred as a JodaTime `DateTime` object.

- `next-build-time`
  When the next build is scheduled to occur (or when the next check to see whether a build should be performed is
  scheduled to occur) as a JodaTime `DateTime` object.

- `:web-url`
  A URL for where more detail can be found about this project exactly as it appeared in the xml file.

- `:prognosis`
  The derived health of the project based on the activity and last build status as a keyword. Either `:sick-building`,
  `:sick`, `:healthy`, `:healthy-building` or `:unknown`

If `:go` or `:snap` are used as `:options` then the following keys will also be added.

- `:stage`
  The projects stage name.

- `:job`
  For projects job name.

## Normalised strings

Normalised strings are lower case and "sentenceized" which means camel, snake and kebab cased words are converted to normal sentences with spaces.

```
CamelCased_Snake-Kebab => camel cased snake kebab
```

## HTTPS

To allow for an easier first use `clj-cctray` does not check SSL certificates by default.

## Local files and remote files can be read

By default, you can load local files on your disk and remote files over http or https. If you are using `clj-cctray` on a webserver then we recommend you lock down the options to only allow reading over http or https.

## Installation

`clj-cctray` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](http://clojars.org/clj-cctray)
